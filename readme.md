# Ortho Appliance Fit/Success Predictor

End-to-end ML pipeline that predicts orthodontic appliance **fit risk** and **success probability** using **3D scans (STL)** + **design parameters**.

- STL âžœ voxel grid via `trimesh`
- Late-fusion model: **3D CNN (scan)** + **MLP (tabular)**
- Train / evaluate / single-scan inference CLIs
- Caches voxelized scans for speed
- Ships with a **synthetic data generator** so you can run it immediately
